# Bellabeat Case Study: Data-Driven Insights for Wellness
## Steps took to create this project 

## Introduction
This repository contains the Bellabeat case study, completed as part of my data analytics portfolio. The objective of the project is to analyze smart device usage data to uncover actionable insights that can help Bellabeat, a high-tech wellness company, improve its offerings and marketing strategies.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For data exploration and querying.
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Google Sheets**: For collaborative analysis and calculations.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing trends.

## Steps Taken

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Cleaned and prepared raw data using Excel and Google Sheets.
- Addressed missing values and ensured consistency in the dataset.

### 2. **Data Analysis**
- Used SQL to explore the dataset and identify patterns in user activity.
- Conducted analysis on variables such as daily activity, sleep patterns, and calorie consumption.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to present the insights in a clear and engaging format.
- Created visualizations that highlight trends in activity levels, sleep duration, and user engagement.

## Key Findings
- **Activity Levels**: Users who maintained consistent physical activity throughout the week had higher calorie burn rates.
- **Sleep Patterns**: A significant correlation was observed between sleep duration and overall wellness scores.
- **User Engagement**: Peak user activity occurred during morning hours, suggesting an opportunity for targeted wellness campaigns.

## Conclusion
The insights derived from the analysis provide Bellabeat with valuable information to guide product improvements and marketing strategies. Recommendations include:
1. Promoting consistent activity through personalized challenges.
2. Emphasizing the importance of sleep in their wellness messaging.
3. Scheduling notifications or updates to align with peak activity times.
